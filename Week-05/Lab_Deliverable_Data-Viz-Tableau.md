## Challenge 1

3. Let's start our analysis by looking at the number of games played per year. 
    
This visualization is still not "number of games played per year". Because the games played information is double counted (once for each team). *How to fix the issue?*
    >> Divide all sums by 2

4. Win/loss proportions of each team by year in pie charts. 
   
5. Playing at home or away has an impact on how often a team wins.
Considering the total number of games, winning approximately 280 more games at home than away, indicates this advantage is significant.

6. Team's effectiveness 
    
7. The team with highest percent of pass completions in 2016 was Minnesota Viking, with an average of 70%.

8. Let's look at Percentage Completion as a more interesting visualization than just a table.

9. Let's look at how some defensive statistics 

10. Let's create one last visualization that shows how well each team's defense prevents its opponents from scoring.
